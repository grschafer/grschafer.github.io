Go project reinforced one of the things I appreciate most about programming: that such a large percentage of time is spent working on things that you don't know how to do (well), that you're forced to read, discuss, hypothesize, and run experiments to constantly keep learning more.

Jumping into something new (e.g. a language):
-low productivity
-frustration
-fumbling around in the dark
But you learn so much more when struggling and progress/achievement is much more pronounced
