*How to Play*

Play in the applet above, or [download the source][src] and open it in the
Processing IDE

* Push R to reset
* Push C to continue after a green-pink collision
* ` (backtick/tilde) for debug info

*What*

After using fisica for SpinMaze, I wanted to make a physics sandbox-y sort of
particle/molecule games. Particles of different colors can interact in
different ways.

*Tech*

[Processing][proc] with [fisica library][fisica] for physics
