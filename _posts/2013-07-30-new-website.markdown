Welcome to my new home on the internet! My site on Google AppEngine was a few
years out of date, so I took the opportunity to switch over to [jekyll][jekyll]
and [GitHub Pages][ghpages] for a (hopefully) more maintainable site. 

I'll be populating this site over time with:

* Current or (mostly) finished software/hardware *projects*
* *Thoughts*, essays, and other ramblings
* *Guides* and postmortems for my development undertakings
* Posts about other *hobbies* (gaming, sports, cooking, etc.)

Thanks for visiting! =)
